# Depthboot

Welcome to the Depthboot wiki.  
Due to licensing restraints, Depthboot cannot be distributed as an iso. Instead, it has to be build locally.  
If you do not want to build a Depthboot image, you can download an iso of our Fedora based
distribution, [EupneaOS](https://eupnea-linux.github.io).
