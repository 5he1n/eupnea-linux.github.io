# The Eupnea Project

Welcome to the Eupnea Project wiki. We are a small dev team creating projects to run Linux on Chromebooks.

## Depthboot

Due to licensing restraints, Depthboot cannot be distributed as an iso. Instead, it has to be build locally.

## EupneaOS

The Eupnea Project develops a custom Linux distribution based on [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) called EupneaOS. It's
designed to imitate the look of ChromeOS and is the recommended way of upgrading your Chromebook. It is designed to
replicate most features of ChromeOS, but without any limitations.
